            A new Full-stack Developer eager to continue learning as much as possible about software development.
            <br />
            My goal is to deliver efficient and effective solutions and be a positive contributor to an organization:
            <br />
            - I focus on providing solutions that address the client's needs and solve their problems.
            <br />
            - I believe in working in a field you enjoy, and the past 5 months of learning JavaScript and React have been some of my favorites.
